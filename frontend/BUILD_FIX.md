# Build Fix: Import Path Resolution

## Issue
Production build (`npm run build`) was failing with:
```
Could not resolve "../../lib/utils" from "src/components/ui/card.jsx"
```

## Root Cause
The UI components were using relative imports (`../../lib/utils`) instead of the configured Vite path alias (`@`). While this works in development, Rollup (Vite's bundler) can have issues resolving relative imports during production builds, especially across different directory levels.

## Solution
Updated all UI component imports to use the `@` path alias defined in `vite.config.js`:

```javascript
// Before
import { cn } from "../../lib/utils"

// After
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
```

### Files Modified
- `src/components/ui/card.jsx`
- `src/components/ui/input.jsx`
- `src/components/ui/checkbox.jsx`
- `src/components/ui/button.jsx`
- `src/components/ui/label.jsx`
- `src/components/ui/separator.jsx`
- `src/components/ui/switch.jsx`
- `src/components/ui/tabs.jsx`

## Verification

### Build Test
```bash
npm run build
# âœ“ built in 2.83s
```

### Test Suite
```bash
npm test -- --run
# 3 test files passed (13 tests)
```

## Benefits of Using Path Aliases
1. **Consistent imports** - No need to calculate relative paths
2. **Better bundling** - Rollup resolves aliases more reliably
3. **Easier refactoring** - Moving files doesn't break imports
4. **Cleaner code** - `@/lib/utils` is more readable than `../../lib/utils`

## Notes
The build produces a minor warning about dynamic imports in `websocket-manager.js`, but this is informational only and doesn't affect functionality:
```
websocket-manager.js is dynamically imported by YappersPage.jsx 
but also statically imported by WebSocketContext.jsx
```

This is expected behavior and the module is correctly bundled.
